  "description": "Find file contents via various criteria. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).\n\n**Note:** You must [authenticate](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) to search for code across all public repositories.\n\n**Considerations for code search**\n\nDue to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:\n\n*   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.\n*   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.\n*   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.\n\nThe `q` search term can also contain any combination of the supported code search qualifiers as described by the in-browser [code search documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/) and [search syntax documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/search-syntax/):\n\n*   [`in`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#scope-the-search-fields) Qualifies which fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the search to the file contents (`file`), the file path (`path`), or both.\n*   [`language`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-by-language) Searches code based on the language it's written in.\n*   [`fork`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-by-the-number-of-forks-the-parent-repository-has) Specifies that code from forked repositories should be searched (`true`). Repository forks will not be searchable unless the fork has more stars than the parent repository.\n*   [`size`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-by-the-size-of-the-parent-repository) Finds files that match a certain size (in bytes).\n*   [`path`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-by-the-location-of-a-file-within-the-repository) Specifies the path prefix that the resulting file must be under.\n*   [`filename`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-by-filename) Matches files by a substring of the filename.\n*   [`extension`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-by-the-file-extension) Matches files with a certain extension after a dot.\n*   [`user` or `repo`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code#search-within-a-users-or-organizations-repositories) Limits searches to a specific user or repository.\n\nSuppose you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). Your query would look something like this:\n\nHere, we're searching for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. We're making sure that we're only looking in files where the language is JavaScript. And we're scoping the search to the `repo:jquery/jquery` repository.\n\n**Highlighting code search results**\n\nYou might want to highlight the matching search terms when displaying search results. The API offers additional metadata to support this use case. To get this metadata in your search results, specify the `text-match` media type in your `Accept` header. For example, via cURL, the above query would look like this:\n\nThis produces the same JSON payload as above, with an extra key called `text_matches`, an array of objects. These objects provide information such as the position of your search terms within the text, as well as the `property` that included the search term.\n\nWhen searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields. For details on the attributes present in the `text_matches` array, see [text match metadata](#text-match-metadata).\n\nHere's an example response:",
