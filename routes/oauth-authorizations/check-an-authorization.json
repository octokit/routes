Authentication works differently with this particular endpoint. You must use [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth#basic-authentication) when accessing it, where the username is the OAuth application `client_id` and the password is its `client_secret`. Invalid tokens will return `404 NOT FOUND`.",
