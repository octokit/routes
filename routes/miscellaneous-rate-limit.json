For that reason, the response (shown above) categorizes your rate limit by resource. Within the `\"resources\"` object, the `\"search\"` object provides your rate limit status for the [Search API](/v3/search). The `\"core\"` object provides your rate limit status for all the _rest_ of the API.\n\nThe `\"rate\"` object (shown at the bottom of the response above) is deprecated.\n\nIf you're writing new API client code (or updating your existing code), you should use the `\"core\"` object instead of the `\"rate\"` object. The `\"core\"` object contains the same information that is present in the `\"rate\"` object.",
