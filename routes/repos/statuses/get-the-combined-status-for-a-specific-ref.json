The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name.\n\nThe most recent status for each context is returned, up to 100. This field [paginates](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination) if there are over 100 contexts.\n\nAdditionally, a combined `state` is returned. The `state` is one of:\n\n*   **failure** if any of the contexts report as `error` or `failure`\n*   **pending** if there are no statuses or a context is `pending`\n*   **success** if the latest status for all contexts is `success`",
