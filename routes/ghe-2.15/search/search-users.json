We're only interested in those with more than 42 repositories, and only if they have over 1,000 followers.\n\n**Highlighting user search results**\n\nYou might want to highlight the matching search terms when displaying search results. The API offers additional metadata to support this use case. To get this metadata in your search results, specify the `text-match` media type in your `Accept` header. For example, via cURL, the above query would look like this:\n\nThis produces the same JSON payload as above, with an extra key called `text_matches`, an array of objects. These objects provide information such as the position of your search terms within the text, as well as the `property` that included the search term.\n\nWhen searching for users, you can get text match metadata for the issue **login**, **email**, and **name** fields. For details on the attributes present in the `text_matches` array, see [text match metadata](#text-match-metadata).",
