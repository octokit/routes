In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.\n\nThe `q` search term can also contain any combination of the supported commit search qualifiers as described by the in-browser [commit search documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits/) and [search syntax documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/search-syntax/):\n\n*   [`author`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-author-or-committer) Matches commits authored by a user (based on email settings).\n*   [`committer`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-author-or-committer) Matches commits committed by a user (based on email settings).\n*   [`author-name`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-author-or-committer) Matches commits by author name.\n*   [`committer-name`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-author-or-committer) Matches commits by committer name.\n*   [`author-email`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-author-or-committer) Matches commits by author email.\n*   [`committer-email`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-author-or-committer) Matches commits by committer email.\n*   [`author-date`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-authored-or-committed-date) Matches commits by author date range.\n*   [`committer-date`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits/#search-by-authored-or-committed-date) Matches commits by committer date range.\n*   [`merge`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#filter-merge-commits) `true` filters to merge commits, `false` filters out merge commits.\n*   [`hash`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-hash) Matches commits by hash.\n*   [`parent`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-parent) Matches commits that have a particular parent.\n*   [`tree`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-by-tree) Matches commits by tree hash.\n*   [`is`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#filter-to-public-or-private-repositories) Matches `public` or `private` repositories.\n*   [`user`, `org`, or `repo`](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits#search-within-a-users-or-organizations-repositories) Limits searches to a specific user, organization, or repository.\n\nSuppose you want to find commits related to CSS in the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository.
