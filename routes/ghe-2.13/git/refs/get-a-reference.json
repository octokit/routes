For more information, see \"[Checking mergeability of pull requests](/enterprise/2.13/v3/git/#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\".\n\nThe `ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/branch`, not just `branch`. For example, the call to get the data for a branch named `skunkworkz/featureA` would be:\n\n```\nGET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/heads/skunkworkz/featureA\n```\n\nIf the `ref` doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with `ref` they will be returned as an array. For example, a call to get the data for a branch named `feature`, which doesn't exist, would return head refs including `featureA` and `featureB` which do.\n\n```\nGET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/heads/feature\n```\n\nIf the `ref` doesn't match an existing ref or any prefixes a 404 will be returned.\n\n```\nGET /repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/heads/feature-branch-that-no-longer-exists\n```",
