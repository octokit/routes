  "description": "The API returns a [`301 Moved Permanently` status](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.16/v3/#http-redirects) if the issue was [transferred](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository/) to another repository. If the issue was transferred to or deleted from a repository where the authenticated user lacks read access, the API returns a `404 Not Found` status. If the issue was deleted from a repository where the authenticated user has read access, the API returns a `410 Gone` status. To receive webhook events for transferred and deleted issues, subscribe to the [`issues`](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.16/v3/activity/events/types/#issuesevent) webhook.\n\n**Note**: GitHub's REST API v3 considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, \"Issues\" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key.\n\nBe aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from \"Issues\" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the \"[List pull requests](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.16/v3/pulls/#list-pull-requests)\" endpoint.",
