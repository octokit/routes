The GitHub App must be authenticated as a user. See \"[Identifying and authorizing users for GitHub Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/)\" for details about authentication. For an example response, see \"[Response with GitHub plan information](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#response-with-github-plan-information).\"\n\nThe `email` key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your GitHub [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile). When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be “public” which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for `email`, then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub. For more information, see [Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication).\n\nThe Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly. For more information, see \"[Emails API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/emails/)\".",
