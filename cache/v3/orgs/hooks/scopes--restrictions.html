<p>All actions against organization webhooks require the authenticated user to be an admin of the organization being managed. Additionally, OAuth tokens require <a href="/apps/building-integrations/setting-up-and-registering-oauth-apps/about-scopes-for-oauth-apps/">the <code>admin:org_hook</code> scope</a>.</p>
<p>In order to protect sensitive data which may be present in webhook configurations, we also enforce the following access control rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>OAuth applications cannot list, view, or edit webhooks which they did not create.</li>
<li>Users cannot list, view, or edit webhooks which were created by OAuth applications.</li>
</ul>
