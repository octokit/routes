<p>When retrieving responses from the Notifications API, each payload has a key titled
<code>reason</code>. These correspond to events that trigger a notification.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s a list of potential <code>reason</code>s for receiving a notification:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Reason Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>assign</code></td>
<td>You were assigned to the Issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>author</code></td>
<td>You created the thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>comment</code></td>
<td>You commented on the thread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>invitation</code></td>
<td>You accepted an invitation to contribute to the repository.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>manual</code></td>
<td>You subscribed to the thread (via an Issue or Pull Request).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>mention</code></td>
<td>You were specifically <strong>@mentioned</strong> in the content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>state_change</code></td>
<td>You changed the thread state (for example, closing an Issue or merging a Pull Request).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>subscribed</code></td>
<td>You&apos;re watching the repository.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>team_mention</code></td>
<td>You were on a team that was mentioned.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the <code>reason</code> is modified on a per-thread basis, and can change, if the
<code>reason</code> on a later notification is different.</p>
<p>For example, if you are the author of an issue, subsequent notifications on that
issue will have a <code>reason</code> of <code>author</code>. If you&apos;re then  <strong>@mentioned</strong> on the same
issue, the notifications you fetch thereafter will have a <code>reason</code> of <code>mention</code>.
The <code>reason</code> remains as <code>mention</code>, regardless of whether you&apos;re ever mentioned again.</p>
